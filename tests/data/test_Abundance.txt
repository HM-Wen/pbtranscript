# Field explanation
# -----------------
# count_fl: Number of associated FL reads
# count_nfl: Number of associated FL + unique nFL reads
# count_nfl_amb: Number of associated FL + unique nFL + weighted ambiguous nFL reads
# norm_fl: count_fl / total number of FL reads
# norm_nfl: count_nfl / total number of FL + unique nFL reads
# norm_nfl_amb: count_nfl_amb / total number of all reads
# Total Number of FL reads: 4712
# Total Number of FL + unique nFL reads: 9879
# Total Number of all reads: 10064
